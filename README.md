# Redis Operations

A comprehensive project to master **Redis** using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, designed as a feature-rich social media simulation platform.  
Learn and apply Redis data structures, commands, and best practices through real-world-like use cases and backend operations.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with Redis by building various backend features commonly found in social media platforms. Instead of isolated Redis examples, each task simulates a realistic use case, helping you deeply understand Redis capabilities and their application in Java backend development.

---

## Key Features

- **String Operations:** User profile caching and simple counters
- **Hashes:** Storing user metadata and settings
- **Lists:** Timeline posts and activity feeds
- **Sets:** User followers/following management
- **Sorted Sets:** Leaderboards, trending posts, and scoring systems
- **Pub/Sub:** Real-time notifications and messaging
- **Bitmaps & HyperLogLog:** User engagement and analytics
- **Streams:** Event sourcing and message queues
- **Transactions & Lua Scripts:** Atomic operations and complex logic
- **Caching Strategies:** Cache aside, write-through, TTL management
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Dynamic API rate limiting implementation
- **Security:** Using Redis for session storage and blacklisting
- **Integration:** Full integration with Spring Boot, using `Lettuce` client and Spring Data Redis

---

## Tech Stack

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3.x
